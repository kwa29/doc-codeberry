# Core Components

## Instructions

Instructions allow you to guide codeberry through the code generation. You can define and manage guidelines that it will follow. They are written in Markdown and can be as simple or as complex as you need them to be. 

This includes:
- Specifying coding standards and best practices
- Defining architectural patterns to be followed
- Setting project-specific rules for code structure
- Providing context-sensitive instructions for different types of tasks

### Key Features of Instructions:
- Markdown-based for easy writing and formatting
- Flexible complexity to suit various needs
- Project-specific customization
- Integration with code generation process

### Best Practices:
1. Start with clear, concise instructions and expand as needed
2. Use examples to illustrate complex concepts
3. Keep instructions up-to-date with your project's evolving needs
4. Organize instructions into logical sections for easy reference
5. Use Markdown formatting to enhance readability (e.g., headers, lists, code blocks)

### Managing Instructions:
- To create new instructions: Look for an "Add Instructions" or "+" button in the Instructions tab
- To edit instructions: Open the instruction set and look for an "Edit" option
- To apply instructions: Instructions are automatically applied during code generation based on the context
- To organize instructions: Use headers and sections to group related guidelines
