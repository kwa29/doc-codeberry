# Core Components

## Projects

Projects serve as a container for organizing and managing your developer work, typically corresponding to a single repository. Projects provide a structured way to compartmentalize your issues, templates, and instructions, ensuring that your work remains organized, individualized, and easily accessible.

In the sidebar, you'll see all your projects. Click on a project's dropdown to switch to view project's context where it will house its exclusive issues, templates, and instructions. You'll also see the option to create a new project by clicking the "+" button.

### Key Features of Projects:
- Organize work related to a specific repository
- House project-specific issues, templates, and instructions
- Easy switching between different projects
- Create new projects on the fly

### Best Practices:
1. Create a project for each distinct codebase or repository

### Managing Projects:
- To create a new project: Click the "+" button in the sidebar
