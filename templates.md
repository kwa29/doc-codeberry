# Core Components

## Templates

Templates are for reusable issues. If you find yourself creating issues that frequently use similar wording and similar instructions, it might be best to create a template to save you time. 

In this tab, you can:
- Create new templates for predefined issue structures
- View and manage existing templates
- Attach specific prompts to templates for even more precise, consistent instructions. Whenever that template is selected during issue creation, the prompt will be attached to the issue as well

### Key Features of Templates:
- Reusable issue structures
- Time-saving for repetitive tasks
- Customizable prompts for consistent instructions
- Improved consistency across similar issues

### Best Practices:
1. Create templates for common issue types (e.g., bug reports, feature requests)
2. Use clear and descriptive names for your templates
3. Include placeholders for variable information in your templates
4. Regularly review and update templates to ensure they remain relevant
5. Attach appropriate prompts to templates for more detailed guidance

### Managing Templates:
- To create a new template: Look for a "New Template" or "+" button in the Templates tab
- To use a template: Select the template when creating a new issue
- To edit a template: Open the template and look for an "Edit" option
- To attach a prompt to a template: Look for a "Attach Prompt" or similar option when creating or editing a template
