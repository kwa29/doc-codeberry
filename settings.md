# Core Components

## Settings

The Settings tab is the place to handle GitHub integration. It's also where you configure the repository and branch that the selected codeberry project will run on.

### Key Features of Settings:
- GitHub integration configuration
- Repository and branch selection
- Project-specific configurations

### Managing Settings:
- GitHub Integration:
  - Connect your GitHub account
  - Select repositories for codeberry to access
  - Manage permissions and access tokens
- Repository Configuration:
  - Choose the main repository for the current project
  - Select the branch to work on (e.g., main, development)
- Project Settings:
  - Set project-specific parameters
  - Configure default behaviors for the project

### Best Practices:
1. Regularly review and update your GitHub integration settings
2. Use separate branches for development and production
3. Keep your access tokens secure and rotate them periodically
4. Document any project-specific settings for team reference

### Tips:
- If you're working on multiple projects, double-check the repository and branch settings when switching between them
- Consider using environment variables for sensitive information rather than storing them directly in project settings
- Collaborate with your team to establish consistent settings across projects
