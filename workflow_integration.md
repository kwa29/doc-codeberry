## Workflow Integration

Buildware seamlessly integrates into existing development workflows:

1. Sign into Buildware, quickly setup GitHub integration, and select your project.
2. If you'd like, create Prompts to guide Buildware through more specific requirements.
3. Create an issue in the Issues tab.
4. Click "Run" and Buildware will generate a plan and code solution.
5. Now click into the automated GitHub PR link and review, refine, and integrate the code into your project!

It's as easy as that! For specific setup instructions, see our README on GitHub.

### Key Features of Workflow Integration:
- Seamless GitHub integration
- Automated code generation
- Pull Request (PR) creation
- Easy review and refinement process

### Best Practices:
1. Keep your GitHub integration up-to-date
2. Use descriptive issue titles and descriptions for better code generation
3. Review generated code thoroughly before merging
4. Utilize Prompts to fine-tune Buildware's output for your project's needs

### Tips:
- Integrate Buildware into your team's code review process
- Use Buildware-generated code as a starting point, and refine as needed
- Regularly update your project's Instructions to keep Buildware aligned with your evolving needs

### Troubleshooting:
- If you encounter issues with GitHub integration, ensure your access tokens are valid and have the necessary permissions
- If generated code doesn't meet expectations, try refining your issue description or adjusting your project's Instructions
