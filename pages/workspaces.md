## Workspaces

Workspaces act as high-level containers for organizing and grouping related projects. They provide a way to structure your work at a broader level, allowing you to categorize and manage multiple projects within a single, unified space.

In the sidebar, you'll see a dropdown in the top left corner. This displays your current workspace. Clicking on the dropdown will allow you to switch between workspaces. Click on a workspace to view and access the projects it contains. 

Within the dropdown, you can also:
- Create new workspaces by clicking the "Create Workspace" button
- Access the workspace settings by clicking the "Workspace Settings" button

### Key Features of Workspaces:
- Organize multiple projects
- Easy switching between different workspaces
- Create new workspaces on the fly
- Manage workspace settings

### Best Practices:
1. Group related projects within a workspace
2. Use descriptive names for your workspaces
3. Regularly review and organize your workspaces
