## Issues

Issues are just the tasks you want done for a specific project. Simple as that. The Issues tab for each project serves as the central hub for managing these development tasks. 

Here, you can:
- Create new issues with detailed descriptions and requirements
- View and manage existing issues
- Generate code solutions for specific issues

### Key Features of Issues:
- Task tracking for each project
- Detailed issue descriptions and requirements
- Code generation capabilities
- Status tracking (e.g., open, in progress, closed)

### Best Practices:
1. Write clear and concise issue descriptions
2. Include all necessary details and requirements in each issue
3. Use labels or tags to categorize issues (e.g., bug, feature, enhancement)
4. Regularly update issue statuses
5. Link related issues when applicable

### Managing Issues:
- To create a new issue: Click the "New Issue" or "+" button in the Issues tab
- To view an issue: Click on the issue title in the list
- To update an issue: Open the issue and use the provided fields or buttons
- To generate code for an issue: Look for a "Generate Code" or similar button within the issue view
